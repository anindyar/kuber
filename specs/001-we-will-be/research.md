# Research: Kubernetes TUI Manager Technology Choices

## Language Selection

### Decision: Go
**Rationale**: 
- Native language of Kubernetes ecosystem
- Excellent performance/development speed balance (2× faster than Python, <10ms GC pauses)
- Most mature Kubernetes client library (client-go)
- Largest community for Kubernetes tooling
- Single binary deployment

**Alternatives considered**:
- **Rust**: Superior performance but steeper learning curve and smaller Kubernetes ecosystem
- **Python**: Fastest development but 30× slower performance and requires runtime installation

## TUI Framework Selection

### Decision: Bubble Tea
**Rationale**:
- Modern Elm-architecture based functional design
- Production ready (v1.0 released in 2025)
- 10,000+ applications built with it
- Active development and community support
- Clean functional patterns ideal for state management

**Alternatives considered**:
- **tview**: Battle-tested (powers k9s) but less modern architecture
- **termui**: Inactive project, maintainer seeking new ownership
- **ratatui (Rust)**: Excellent performance but tied to Rust ecosystem

## Kubernetes Client Library

### Decision: client-go (Official Go client)
**Rationale**:
- Most mature and feature-complete
- Backwards compatible across Kubernetes versions
- Extensive documentation and community resources
- Highly optimized for Kubernetes operations

**Alternatives considered**:
- **kube-rs (Rust)**: CNCF Sandbox project, good performance but smaller community
- **kubernetes-client (Python)**: Easy to use but performance unsuitable for real-time monitoring

## Testing Framework

### Decision: Go built-in testing + teatest
**Rationale**:
- `go test` provides excellent built-in tooling
- `teatest` specifically designed for Bubble Tea applications
- Standard HTTP mocking works well for Kubernetes API testing
- Consistent with Go ecosystem practices

**Alternatives considered**:
- **cargo test (Rust)**: Robust but tied to Rust ecosystem
- **pytest (Python)**: Industry standard but Python performance limitations

## Performance Targets Validation

Based on research findings:
- **Response Time**: Go + Bubble Tea easily achieves <100ms navigation response
- **Memory Usage**: Go applications typically use 10-50MB idle, meeting <50MB constraint
- **Real-time Updates**: Bubble Tea's functional architecture ideal for real-time log streaming
- **Scalability**: client-go handles thousands of resources efficiently

## Development Timeline

- **MVP Development**: 2-3 months with Go + Bubble Tea
- **Learning Curve**: Minimal for developers familiar with Go
- **Maintenance**: Low due to Go's stability and Bubble Tea's functional architecture

## Technical Risk Assessment

**Low Risk**:
- Go ecosystem stability
- Bubble Tea maturity and community adoption
- client-go backwards compatibility

**Mitigated Risks**:
- TUI complexity handled by framework abstractions
- Kubernetes API changes handled by client-go compatibility layers
- Terminal compatibility managed by Bubble Tea's terminal abstraction

## Integration Considerations

- **Kubernetes Authentication**: client-go handles kubeconfig, service accounts, RBAC
- **Terminal Compatibility**: Bubble Tea supports all standard terminal capabilities
- **Cross-platform**: Go + Bubble Tea works on Linux/macOS/Windows
- **Distribution**: Single binary simplifies deployment and updates
