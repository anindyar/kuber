# Feature Specification: Intuitive Kubernetes TUI Manager

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-will-be`  
**Created**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "we will be building a very intutive kubernetes manager for Linux TUI. This should have features of suse rancher or k9s, but it should look better, like lazzydocker. we should be able to browser all kubernetes resources, modify them, take shell of pods, see logs and performance matrices."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A DevOps engineer or Kubernetes administrator needs to efficiently manage and monitor Kubernetes clusters through a terminal-based interface. They want to quickly navigate between different Kubernetes resources, view their status, make modifications, access pod shells, examine logs, and monitor performance metrics without switching between multiple command-line tools or web interfaces.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a running Kubernetes cluster, **When** user launches the TUI application, **Then** they see an intuitive dashboard showing cluster overview with navigation options
2. **Given** the main dashboard is displayed, **When** user navigates to pods section, **Then** they see a list of all pods with their status, resource usage, and navigation controls
3. **Given** a pod is selected, **When** user chooses to view logs, **Then** real-time logs are displayed in a readable format with scrolling capabilities
4. **Given** a pod is selected, **When** user chooses to open shell access, **Then** an interactive shell session is established within the pod
5. **Given** any Kubernetes resource is selected, **When** user chooses to edit, **Then** they can modify the resource configuration through an intuitive interface
6. **Given** the application is running, **When** user navigates to performance metrics, **Then** they see real-time resource usage charts and statistics

### Edge Cases
- What happens when cluster connection is lost during operation?
- How does system handle unauthorized access to restricted resources?
- What occurs when attempting to shell into a pod that doesn't support it?
- How are very large log files handled without overwhelming the interface?
- What happens when modifying resources that have dependencies?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide an intuitive terminal-based user interface for Kubernetes cluster management
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow browsing of all standard Kubernetes resources (pods, services, deployments, configmaps, secrets, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST enable viewing and editing of Kubernetes resource configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide shell access to containers within pods
- **FR-005**: System MUST display real-time and historical logs from pods and containers
- **FR-006**: System MUST show performance metrics and resource usage statistics
- **FR-007**: System MUST support navigation between different resource types and individual resources
- **FR-008**: System MUST connect to and manage multiple Kubernetes clusters [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: simultaneous or sequential cluster management?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide visual feedback for resource states (running, pending, failed, etc.)
- **FR-010**: System MUST support filtering and searching within resource lists
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle real-time updates of resource states and metrics
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide keyboard shortcuts for efficient navigation
- **FR-013**: System MUST display resource relationships and dependencies [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific relationship types and depth]
- **FR-014**: System MUST support resource scaling operations (deployments, replicasets, etc.)
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- **FR-016**: System MUST support copying resource configurations and manifests
- **FR-017**: System MUST authenticate with Kubernetes clusters using standard methods [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific auth methods - kubeconfig, service accounts, RBAC requirements?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST respect Kubernetes RBAC permissions and show appropriate access levels
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide help and documentation within the interface
- **FR-020**: System MUST support customizable themes and layouts [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: extent of customization options]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: Represents a connected cluster with its endpoint, authentication, and available resources
- **Resource Object**: Any Kubernetes resource (pod, service, deployment, etc.) with its metadata, spec, and status
- **Log Entry**: Individual log lines from pods/containers with timestamp, source, and content
- **Metric Data Point**: Performance measurement with timestamp, resource identifier, and values
- **User Session**: Current user's connection state, active cluster, current view, and preferences
- **Navigation Context**: Current location within the resource hierarchy and history for back/forward navigation
